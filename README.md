# LogFileReader
Simple application to read a text-based log file and display it's contents in real time. When a file is selected, any changes to it are 
updated in the application window. Just download and use the exe file! A tiny xml is automatically made to store settings for when you
next open the appication. The source files require the JUCE library.
